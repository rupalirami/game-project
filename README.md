Dots and Boxes is a game for two players where players take turns to add a single line either horizontal or vertical between two empty dots. A player who completes the fourth side wins the box and gets an additional turn. The winner's initials are placed on the box and their score is updated. The winner of the game is the player with the most points. In the current version of the game, the player is playing against the computer and takes turns for themselves as well as the computer!
